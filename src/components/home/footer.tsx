          I’m a highly motivated Software Engineer with hands-on experience in developing modern web and mobile applications using React and React Native. I specialize in front-end development, where I combine technical precision with an eye for detail to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My core tools include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Mantine, which I use to create visually appealing and accessible designs. I also work efficiently with Redux for state management, ensuring smooth performance across scalable applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring strong soft skills to the table — including effective communication, team collaboration, and problem-solving. I enjoy working in agile environments where I can contribute ideas, learn from others, and continuously improve both the product and the process. I’m passionate about building products that have real impact and am always eager to take on challenges that push my growth. Currently, I’m seeking new career opportunities where I can grow as a developer, be part of a forward-thinking team, and contribute to meaningful, user-focused projects.
